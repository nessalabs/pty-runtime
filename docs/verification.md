# Verification status

Plain-English snapshot of what we have checked and what is still open.
Product behavior lives in [`usage.md`](usage.md), [`features/`](features/), and
[`adr/`](adr/).

## How we check things

- Run `python3 scripts/gate.py` (format, lint, tests, native build).
- Prefer real process and terminal fixtures over mocks.
- Do **not** commit gate logs or load dumps into the repo. Re-run when needed.
- A green experiment does **not** mean “ready to ship.”

## What we found works

- The library can own real Unix terminal sessions and keep reading them with one
  dedicated reader per live session.
- Detach / reconnect does not kill the child process or invent a fake exit.
- When projection is on, Ghostty drives the terminal model; views show size,
  cursor, text, styles, and modes (including mouse tracking) without collapsing
  them into one vague flag.
- Scrollback is read as a history range. Readers do **not** move a shared
  viewport to peek at old lines.
- Decoders refuse snapshot pages that are too large or badly shaped, so a bad
  page cannot force unbounded memory.
- Idle projected sessions can park to an encrypted on-disk checkpoint and come
  back. Abandoned checkpoint dirs from a crashed owner can be cleaned up within
  finite limits (locks, not PID guessing).
- Helper “guardian” binaries are staged so the parent process does not keep a
  writable executable open (avoids fork/ETXTBSY issues).
- The local demo client can edit, scroll history, paste (including images as a
  temp file path), and resize without the worst of the earlier flicker/paste bugs.
- Mechanical gate and a large set of fixtures exist and are the usual proof of
  “this change still works.”

## What is still open

- Full release load goals (large session counts, strict latency budgets, long
  soak) are **not** closed. Short green runs are not a substitute.
- Not every claimed OS/CPU target has a fresh, complete qualification pass on
  current source.
- Restoring a parked session still has careful rules around “ready” vs finishing
  history; that story still needs a clean sign-off against the ADRs.
- Memory packing / reclaiming unused native pages after park/restore is not a
  finished production story.
- Shipping packaging extras (notices, examples, docs completeness) still follow
  the ADRs — re-run the notice script when dependencies change.
